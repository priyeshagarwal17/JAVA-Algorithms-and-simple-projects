Create a class named CarRental that contains fields that hold a renterâ€™s name, zip code, size of the car rented, daily rental fee, length of rental in days, and total rental fee. 

The class contains a constructor that requires all the rental data except the daily rate and total fee, which are calculated based on the size of the car: economy at $29.99 per day, midsize at $38.99 per day, or full size at $43.50 per day. 

The class also includes a display() method that displays all the rental data. Create a subclass named LuxuryCarRental.

This class sets the rental fee at $79.99 per day and prompts the user to respond to the option of including a chauffeur at $200 more per day. 

Override the parent class display() method to include chauffeur fee information. Write an application named UseCarRental that prompts the user for the data needed for a rental and creates an object of the correct type.

Display the total rental fee. Save the files as CarRental.java, LuxuryCarRental.java, and UseCarRental.java.
