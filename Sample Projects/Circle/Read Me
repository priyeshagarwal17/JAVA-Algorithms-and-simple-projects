Create a class named Circle with fields named radius, diameter, and area. 
Include a constructor that sets the radius to 1 and calculates the other two values.
Also include methods named setRadius()and getRadius(). The setRadius() method not only sets the radius, it also calculates the other two values. (The diameter of a circle is twice the radius, and the area of a circle is pi multiplied by the square of the radius. Use the Math class PI constant for this calculation.) 
Save the class as Circle.java.


Create a class named TestCircle whose main() method declares several Circle objects.
Using the setRadius() method, assign one Circle a small radius value, and assign another a larger radius value.
Do not assign a value to the radius of the third circle; instead, retain the value assigned at construction. 
Display all the values for all the Circle objects. 
Save the application as CircleDemo.java.
