Create a class named Painting that contains fields for a paintingâ€™s title, artist, medium (such as water color), price,
and gallery commission. 
Create a constructor that initializes each field to an appropriate default value,
and create instance methods that get and set the fields for title, artist, medium, and price. 
The gallery commission field cannot be set from outside the class; 
it is computed as 20 percent of the price each time the price is set.
Save the class as Painting.java.


Create a class named TestPainting whose main() method declares three Paintingitems.
Create a method that prompts the user for and accepts values for two of the Painting objects,
and leave the third with the default values supplied by the constructor. 
Then display each completed object. 
Finally, display a message that explains the gallery commission rate. Save the application as TestPainting.java.
