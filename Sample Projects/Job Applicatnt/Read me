Create a class that holds data about a job applicant. Include a name, a phone number, and four Boolean fields that represent whether the applicant is skilled in each of the following areas: word processing, spreadsheets, databases, and graphics. 
Include a constructor that accepts values for each of the fields. Also include a get method for each field.
Create an application that instantiates several job applicant objects and pass each in turn to a Boolean method that determines whether each applicant is qualified for an interview. 
Then, in the main() method, display an appropriate method for each applicant.
A qualified applicant has at least three of the four skills.
Save the files as JobApplicant.java and TestJobApplicants.java.
